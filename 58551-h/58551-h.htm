<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>Many years ago, there lived
in the high regions of Switzerland
and France a people called
the Lake-Dwellers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>These people did not live on
land, as we do, but on the many
lakes hidden among the high
mountains.</p>
<p>The mountain-sides were thick
with forests which hid the lake-houses
from the
people who lived
on the land.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_02.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="332" height="400" />
</div>
<p>Lodrix was the
chief&rsquo;s son, and
he was a very
brave boy though he was only
twelve years old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>This little boy had flaxen hair
and blue eyes. His fair skin was
very much tanned, because he was
out of doors much of the time.</p>
<p>His clothing was of deerskin
and was thrown
loosely about him.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_03.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="331" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Lodrix looked very
much like his mother,
but her dress
was very different.</p>
<p>Her waist
was of coarse
brown cloth fastened under a
skirt of deerskin, and her shoulders
and arms were bare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Her thick light hair was coiled
on the top of her head and had
many bone and bronze pins in it.</p>
<p>Around her neck were beads
of amber, bone and glass, and a
necklace made from the teeth of
wolves.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_04.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="350" height="337" />
</div>
<p>On her arms and legs she
wore wide bronze bracelets. She
was very proud
of them, because
not many women
among the Lake-Dwellers
had bracelets made of
bronze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Lodrix&rsquo;s father, the chief of
the Dormorants, was a very
brave man.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_05.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="335" height="500" />
</div>
<p>His people
loved him and always
obeyed him.</p>
<p>One day, when
the chief and his
son were on the
lake fishing, they heard the sound
of a horn.</p>
<p>Lodrix listened, then said,
&ldquo;That is mother&rsquo;s call; she
must need us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>In great haste they paddled
toward the sound of the horn,
and across the lake they could
see the mother waving her
hands to them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_06.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="324" height="500" />
</div>
<p>She stood on a platform which
was built upon
thousands of cedar
piles, driven
into the bottom
of the lake.</p>
<p>These piles
were held in
place by stones
and rushes that had been let
down into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>As they paddled nearer, they
could see that something had
happened.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_07.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="210" height="501" />
</div>
<p>They hurried to
climb the notched ladder
which led to the
platform.</p>
<p>Then they followed
the mother into the
one-room hut which was their
home.</p>
<p>They sat down on blocks of
wood about the stone fire-place,
while the mother told the chief
what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_08.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="434" />
</div>
<p>She said that one of their
tribe, who had just returned
from hunting, had told her that
the Bear tribe on the land was
getting ready to burn down the
Lake-Dweller homes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>When Lodrix heard this, he
ran to his father and said, &ldquo;May
I get ready to fight, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief put his hands on
his son&rsquo;s head, saying, &ldquo;My
brave boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told Lodrix to go
out and call the people together.</p>
<p>Soon they came, hundreds of
them, from the many square huts
which were crowded about the
chief&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>These houses were built from
cedar poles matted together with
twigs and plastered both inside
and out with two or three inches
of clay.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_10.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="165" height="500" />
</div>
<p>There were one or
two small windows
without shutters and
one low door.</p>
<p>The roofs were made
of straw or rushes
and the floors were
often plastered with
clay and gravel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>In the center of the roof was
a hole through which the smoke
escaped, and in the floor was a
small trap-door that opened over
the lake.</p>
<p>The Lake-Dwellers often fished
from these doors.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE HOME</span></h2>
<p>While Lodrix summoned the
people, the chief rushed out to
pull back the drawbridge which
connected their homes with the
land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The lake people were very
much frightened. They knew
that the people on land were
their enemies; so they were
ready to obey every command of
their chief.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_13.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="286" height="400" />
</div>
<p>First he called
for the messenger
who had brought
the news.</p>
<p>A youth with
a deer hanging
from his shoulder
stepped forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Laying the deer at the chief&rsquo;s
feet, the boy said, &ldquo;My chief!
As I was hunting, I met the
boy Tevico, whom you once saved
from the wolves in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that his tribe
was getting ready to make war
upon us and to burn our dwellings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hurried here to tell
you, that we, too, might prepare
for war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Lodrix, running into
the house, shouted, &ldquo;O father!
Come quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out rushed the chief, followed
by his people.</p>
<p>What they saw made them
tremble with fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>On the shore of the lake stood
hundreds of people waving their
stone axes and shouting in great
anger.</p>
<p>The chief had pulled up the
drawbridge just in time.</p>
<p>When the Bear people found
they could not reach the Lake-Dwellers,
they went away.</p>
<p>The chief of the Dormorants
told his people that they must
keep close watch, for their enemies
would surely come back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>After choosing men to guard
the village, the people went back
to their homes, while the chief
and his son went into the house.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_16.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="130" height="400" />
</div>
<p>They sat down on the blocks
of wood which were the only
furniture of their home;
then Lodrix watched
his mother skin the
deer with the sharp
stone knife, and his father
light the fire in the stone
fireplace.</p>
<p>The chief was so hungry
that he ate the deer
meat nearly raw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Lodrix did not care for the
meat, but ate some cakes which
had been made from powdered
grain and cooked on the hot
stones. He ate some sour cherries
too, and plums which had
been picked from the trees on
the shore of the lake and dried.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PREPARATION FOR THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>When the father had finished
eating, Lodrix fed the horses, the
sheep, and the goats that were
waiting outside for their dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The mother threw the bones
of the deer into the lake, through
the trap-door, and laid the skin
in the sun to dry.</p>
<p>When he had made sure that
everything was secure and had
sent Lodrix with a message to
one of the Lake-Dwellers, the
chief lay down on a skin to
sleep.</p>
<p>Lodrix hurried off to do his
father&rsquo;s bidding.</p>
<p>He was to say that the drawbridge
must not be put down for
several days, for they were afraid
the Bear people might enter their
village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>As the chief&rsquo;s son entered the
hut where he was to leave his
message, he
saw a little
baby.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_20.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="350" />
</div>
<p>The baby
was tied by a
long cord to one of the blocks of
wood to keep her from falling
through the trap-door.</p>
<p>He told the baby&rsquo;s father what
the chief had said and then went
toward the child, who stretched
out her little hands to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Lodrix loved babies and was
glad to play with this little
one.</p>
<p>He took her to the trap-door,
keeping tight hold of her hand.
Then he took a basket made of
rushes and lowered it, through
the opening, into the lake.</p>
<p>The baby clapped her hands
with glee as she saw the little
fish squirming in the basket when
Lodrix drew it up.</p>
<p>Lodrix laughed, too, because
the little baby was happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The baby&rsquo;s sister, who sat
grinding grain in the stone mortar,
looked up and smiled at the
happy children.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_22.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="502" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Even the mother smiled as
she worked busily at the loom,
where she was weaving coarse
cloth from threads of flax which
the Lake-Dwellers had raised on
the shore of the lake.</p>
<p>At sunset Lodrix said, &ldquo;good-by&rdquo;
and started for
home.</p>
<p>On his way the
beautiful clear moon
seemed to speak to
him.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_23.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="235" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Lodrix stopped a
moment and prayed to it; prayed
that his people might be safe
from their enemies on the land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>As he walked along, he spoke
to many people who were anxiously
watching the opposite shore.</p>
<p>They were straining their eyes
for the first glimpse of the people
on the land, because they
feared that at nightfall these enemies
might come again.</p>
<p>Lodrix wished to join in the
watch, but he was only a little boy
and the chief said that he must
stay at home with his mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_25.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="304" />
</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON SHORE</span></h2>
<p>So the little boy went into the
house and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_25a.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="300" height="216" />
</div>
<p>The mother
lay down on a
bearskin and
rested her head on a clay crescent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The Lake-Dweller women
needed these head-rests because
they did not take down their
hair when they slept, and the
bronze and bone pins made their
heads very heavy.</p>
<p>And now while the men were
on guard peace rested upon the
village of the Dormorants.</p>
<p>The next day, the watchers
slept while others took their
places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>For three days, the Lake-Dwellers
looked for signs of the
enemy, but the Bear tribe seemed
to have forgotten them
and to have returned
to their homes.</p>
<p>If the Lake-Dweller
chief had been on land,
he might have seen
some of the Bear tribe
hiding behind the tall
oak and cedar trees in
the forest.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_27.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="130" height="600" />
</div>
<p>They were watching
to see what the lake
people would do, and
to report what they
saw to their chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>On the fourth day, when everything
seemed quiet, the chief of
the Dormorants ordered the drawbridge
to be put in place, and
stationed a man at the end to
watch for the enemy. Then he
sent a messenger to the chief of
a Lake-Dweller village near by.</p>
<p>The messenger was to ask the
chief to be ready at any time to
help the Dormorants, if the Bear
tribe should attack them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_28.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="169" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Then the chief ordered his men
to be prepared for battle at any
moment, because he was afraid
that the enemy would soon try
again to reach the village.</p>
<p>He ordered them to sharpen
their swords, lances and axes,
and get ready their bows and
arrows.</p>
<p>Lodrix was so excited that he
could not keep still, and almost
hoped that the enemy would come
back, so that he might have a
chance to fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s son had never been
in a battle, and he was anxious
to take part in one.</p>
<p>He begged his father to let
him take the sword which hung
in the bronze scabbard on the
wall.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_30.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="369" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>But his father gave him another
sword, because the one in
the scabbard was too large and
heavy for a young boy.</p>
<p>Lodrix was very
proud of his sword,
and ran about showing
it to his friends.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_31.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="138" height="599" />
</div>
<p>Soon the men were
ready to start. Some
of them lowered their
cedar dugouts, and
climbed down the
notched poles with
their fishing spears in
their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>They paddled to that part of
the lake where they knew they
could catch some fine fish.</p>
<p>Others crossed the bridge, with
their bows and arrows hanging
from their shoulders.</p>
<p>They wished to kill some deer
in the forest and cut down some
cedar trees for fire-wood.</p>
<p>Lodrix pleaded so hard to go
hunting that his father said he
might go, so he started off with
the men.</p>
<p>They stopped to look at the
fruit trees growing along the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the fruit?&rdquo; asked
Lodrix.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_33.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="490" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Bear people have taken
it!&rdquo; answered one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! They have taken our
grain, too!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>This made Lodrix wish more
than ever that he might fight
these people.</p>
<p>He knew his father would be
angry, too, when they told him
what had been done.</p>
<p>They wondered where they
would get food for the winter.</p>
<p>They knew they must work
very hard to get the soil ready
for more grain, and that they
must fish and hunt a great deal
or they would have no dried meat
to store away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>These thoughts made them very
sad, and they did not say much
as they walked on through the
forests.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_35.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="363" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>

</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LODRIX LOST</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Lodrix, darting
off toward a deer whose antlers
he saw in the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The men smiled at one another,
proud to see their chief&rsquo;s
son fond of the hunt.</p>
<p>They did not follow, for they
wished to see if Lodrix could
kill the deer alone.</p>
<p>They turned toward a mound
which held the tomb where their
former chiefs were buried.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_37.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="343" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>This tomb was a small stone
room which the Lake-Dwellers
had built, and then covered with
soil.</p>
<p>They thought of the time when
they had carried Lodrix&rsquo;s grandfather
to this stone room. The
men had stood about with lighted
torches, and the women with
their hair hanging over their
faces had shed many bitter tears
for the dead chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Then, after they had put the
bronze and stone weapons beside
their chief, they had gathered
about the hill and chosen a new
one.</p>
<p>They always chose for their
new chief the bravest and strongest
man of all the tribe. The
brave and strong chief they chose
that day was Lodrix&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>For a time the men had forgotten
Lodrix, then one of them
said: &ldquo;Lodrix has not come back.
Where can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked about, but could
see no trace of their chief&rsquo;s
son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>With fear in their hearts, they
separated and ran in many directions
through the forest.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_40.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="557" />
</div>
<p>They shouted, &ldquo;Lodrix! Lodrix!&rdquo;
but their calls were not answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>They did not stop to shoot the
deer, but ran on and on, so
anxious were they to find the
boy.</p>
<p>Again and again they called,
but no answer came.</p>
<p>They could not find Lodrix,
and yet they dared not go home
without him.</p>
<p>All day the men hunted for
Lodrix, shouting the boy&rsquo;s name
as loudly as they could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>At nightfall they stood on the
shore of the lake looking toward
their village and wondering how
they could tell their chief that
his son was lost.</p>
<p>Silently they walked toward
the bridge and with bowed
heads they
crossed it.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_42.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="300" height="500" />
</div>
<p>When they
reached the
round hut of
their chief, they
stood quite still,
fearing to go in.</p>
<p>The chief,
who had been watching for his
son, came out of the low door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Where is Lodrix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men stood silent. They
could not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! Where is my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then one of the men said,
&ldquo;He is lost in the forest, my
chief. We looked for him all
day, but could not find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief raised his hands to
the moon, praying that his son
might be found.</p>
<p>Then he asked the men for
the whole story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>It was but a few minutes before
all the men in the village
were roused and a hunting party
started out to look for their
chief&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Some of the men stayed to
guard the homes, but the chief
went with the hunting party.</p>
<div class="img">

<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CAPTURE</span></h2>
<p>Lodrix had no fear as he
chased the deer into the thick
forest.</p>
<p>He forgot that his father had
told him not to stray far from
the men.</p>
<p>On and on he ran, thinking of
nothing but the deer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>At last he saw the beautiful
deer not far away. Softly he
knelt down. He raised his bow
and took steady aim.</p>
<p>He did not hear stealthy footsteps
coming nearer and nearer
behind him.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_46.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="409" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Suddenly he was held in strong
arms, and looking up, he saw
many strange faces about him.</p>
<p>He was too frightened to call
for help, for he knew that these
were the Bear people.</p>
<p>As they carried him away, he
struggled, but the arms that held
him were very strong and he
could not free himself.</p>
<p>They walked on and on,
through the thick forest, farther
and farther away, and Lodrix
wondered where he was going
and what would happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>He thought of his father and
mother and the men who, he
knew, were looking for him.</p>
<p>Tears came to his eyes, but he
did not cry, because he was too
brave a boy.</p>
<p>These people did not talk to
him, nor did they talk to one
another.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_48.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="314" height="400" />
</div>
<p>Lodrix could
hear nothing but
the cry of the
wolves in the distance.</p>
<p>Everything seemed strange, and
the boy did not know where he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>He had never been so far from
home before.</p>
<p>On and on they went.</p>
<p>Lodrix could hardly walk, he
was so tired.</p>
<p>Just as the sun went down,
they came to the village of the
Bear people.</p>
<p>The men led Lodrix to one of
the huts and gave him food.</p>
<p>When he had eaten some meat,
he threw himself on a skin and
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>While he slept, the Bear people
were talking about him and
the chief was deciding what should
be done.</p>
<p>Lodrix slept long, and when
he wakened the sun was shining
through the
doorway.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_50.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="436" />
</div>
<p>The boy
looked about
him in wonder
and for a moment
did not know where he was.</p>
<p>Then he saw Tevico, who was
standing near him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Tevico had been left to guard
the prisoner, but the Bear people
did not know that Lodrix&rsquo;s father
had once saved Tevico&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>This young watcher felt very
friendly toward the Lake-Dweller
people, and he was ready to help
the captive boy.</p>
<p>When Lodrix saw Tevico, he
said, &ldquo;Where am I? Why am
I here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been taken prisoner
by the Bear people because
they hate your father and your
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been left here to
guard you, and I will be your
friend if you will let me.
I have not forgotten that
your father once saved me
from the wolves.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_52.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="369" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must be very
careful not to show my
people that we are friends
or they will not let me
stay with you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get
a chance I will let
your father know
where you are and
how he can
get you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, my people held a
council and decided to kill you,
but I told them that your father
had much bronze which he would
give my tribe for your safe return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lodrix stood up and grasped
Tevico&rsquo;s hand, for he was glad
to find a friend here, among his
enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father will give anything
your people ask for my freedom,&rdquo;
said the boy. &ldquo;Send to him
and tell him where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can not go till my chief
sends me,&rdquo; Tevico said. &ldquo;Do
not fear. You will soon be at
home again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is some deer meat for
you. Eat it, for you must be
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lodrix tried to eat, but could
not, for he was so homesick
that he could scarcely keep from
crying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MESSAGE</span></h2>
<p>Tevico had stooped down and
was looking
through the low
doorway.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_55.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="294" height="500" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes
my chief!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;See! He
is coming toward
this hut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Lodrix looked
too, and saw a large man coming
toward him.</p>
<p>As the chief came up, Lodrix
said to him: &ldquo;Send to my father;
he will give you and your
people all that you ask if you
will take me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask bronze,&rdquo; said the
chief. &ldquo;Will your father give
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief of the Dormorants
has much bronze,&rdquo; said Lodrix.
&ldquo;He will give you all you ask
if you will send a messenger to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Tevico,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;Go to the chief of the Dormorants,
and tell him that we hold
his son a prisoner. We will not
harm him and will
send him home if
he will give us all
the bronze in his
village.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_57.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="314" height="400" />
</div>
<p>Tevico bowed to
his chief and ran swiftly away
through the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>He hurried onward, never stopping
to look at the deer as they
crossed his path or to answer
the birds as they sang in the
tree tops.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_58.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="290" />
</div>
<p>He did not even stop to
rest, though he was panting for
breath.</p>
<p>As he raced on he saw a man
in the distance.</p>
<p>When the man saw Tevico,
he called loudly to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our chief&rsquo;s son is lost in the
forest. Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tevico stopped and waited till
the man came near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your chief?&rdquo; the
boy asked. &ldquo;Is he in the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded his head and
pointed in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see him. I have
news of his son,&rdquo; said Tevico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, I will take
you to him,&rdquo; said the man eagerly,
and away they both ran to
find the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>They did not speak as they
ran swiftly through the forest.</p>
<p>On their way, they met others
of the Lake-Dwellers who had
been searching for Lodrix.</p>
<p>As they came up to the chief,
he was looking sadly about him.</p>
<p>All night long they had hunted,
but had found no trace of the
lost boy.</p>
<p>When Tevico approached, the
chief raised his eyes and looked
at him with wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Then Tevico stood before him
and said: &ldquo;I bear a message
from the chief of my people to
the chief of the Dormorants.
Your son is safe in
the hands of the Bear
people.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_61.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="151" height="601" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give to
my tribe all the bronze
of your village, they will
return your son to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will not give
your bronze, Lodrix will
be killed, because the
Bear people are your enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief listened to the words of
the boy, then called his men to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>He told them what the messenger
had said, then stood silent,
wondering what their answer
would be.</p>
<p>The men wished to fight, but
they knew fighting could not save
Lodrix, for the Bear people would
surely kill him.</p>
<p>Their bronze was very precious
to them and they hated to give
it to their enemies, but they
loved their chief and knew that
Lodrix must be saved. So they
said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chief, what we have is yours.
Take our bronze if it will bring
your son back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the chief said to Tevico:
&ldquo;Hasten back to your chief!
Tell him that the Dormorants
will give to him all the bronze
of their village for the safe return
of Lodrix.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_63.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="364" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to send Lodrix to
the shore of our lake at sunrise.
A messenger will be there who
will give him the bronze he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go, Tevico, and carry
my message to your chief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WITH THE BEAR PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>Tevico turned homeward, leaving
the Lake-Dwellers glad that
they had news of Lodrix, but sad
that they must give their bronze
to their enemies.</p>
<p>Together they walked through
the forest to the shore of the
lake and crossed the bridge to
their village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The women were crowded together,
waiting
for tidings of
Lodrix.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_66.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="429" height="600" />
</div>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s
wife rushed
toward him crying:
&ldquo;Lodrix,
my son! Where
is he? Did you
find him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is safe, but in the hands
of our enemy,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;He will be returned to us at
sunrise, but we must give to
these people all the bronze in
our village.&rdquo; Turning to his
people, he said: &ldquo;Let us collect
our treasure at once, that it may
be ready in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day my son shall repay
you for this great sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, now, to your homes and
bring the precious metal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men started off to obey
the command of their chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Slowly they walked to their
huts and quietly collected what
bronze they had.</p>
<p>It was only a short time before
they were again together at the
chief&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_68.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="312" />
</div>
<p>They entered and placed their
bronze in a pile on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The chief had collected his
bronze too, and motioned to one
of the men to put it with the
rest.</p>
<p>There were many kinds of
weapons in this pile: bronze
scabbards, knives with bronze
handles, bronze hammers, bronze
hooks, and bronze bracelets and
pins which the women had given.</p>
<p>The chief had given most of
all. He had a great amount,
because the people of other lake
villages had often sent him presents
of bronze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The people looked longingly at
the treasure for a few moments,
then, at the order of their chief,
put it in a large skin bag ready
for the messenger.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_70.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="296" height="400" />
</div>
<p>All day long the
Lake-Dwellers thought
of Lodrix in the hands
of the enemy, and they could
hardly wait for the morning when
he would return.</p>
<p>In the village of the Bear
tribe, Lodrix was watching and
waiting for Tevico.</p>
<p>He hoped that the messenger
would find his father, and he
knew that his people would give
their precious bronze for his return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>He almost wished that Tevico
had stayed and that some other
messenger had been sent, for now
he was alone among his
enemies.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_71.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="200" height="501" />
</div>
<p>As Lodrix sat in the
hut, he heard a shout,
and looking up, he saw
a little boy standing in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out, Lodrix,&rdquo;
said the boy. &ldquo;I am the chief&rsquo;s son,
and I will show you our village.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Lodrix jumped up, very glad
to get out of the hut, and the two
boys walked off together through
the village.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_72.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="482" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As they went along, Lodrix
saw many strange things.</p>
<p>He had never seen a land village
before, because his people
never went far from the lake.</p>
<p>These huts were not built on
piles as the lake
huts were, and it
seemed strange to
see no water and
no boats.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_73.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="385" />
</div>
<p>The sheep and goats that were
running about, looked very much
like his own, and as they came toward
Lodrix, they seemed friendly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come to my house,&rdquo; said the
little boy. &ldquo;My father wishes to
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the boys ran toward the
largest hut in the Bear village.</p>
<p>They were out of breath when
they reached it and were glad to
throw themselves on the bearskin
which lay outside the door.</p>
<p>The chief came out of the hut,
and looked kindly at the two
boys.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_74.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="147" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_75.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="594" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>He beckoned Lodrix to him,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much bronze is there
in your father&rsquo;s village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lodrix answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is more bronze in the
village of the Dormorants than
in any other village on the
lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there more than one messenger
can carry?&rdquo; said the
chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must send a strong messenger,&rdquo;
said Lodrix, &ldquo;for our
bronze is very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The chief thought a moment,
then turned to his son and said,
&ldquo;You may take Lodrix about the
village, but do not go far, for
Tevico will return at sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RETURN</span></h2>
<p>Just as the moon was rising
Tevico came.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_78.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="282" height="500" />
</div>
<p>He was very tired,
for his journey had
been a long one, but
he was glad to bring
good news to his people
and to Lodrix.</p>
<p>The Bear people had come together
and were waiting for Tevico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>They were very glad to hear
the message for it meant great
wealth for them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_79.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="581" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>They would now have more
bronze than any other land tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lodrix must be sent home.
We must have a messenger,&rdquo; said
the chief. &ldquo;He must be very
strong, for the bronze is heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_80.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="342" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Then he chose one of the
strongest of the men, who started
off with Lodrix.</p>
<p>At sunrise, they reached the
shore of the lake.</p>
<p>There the Lake-Dweller messenger
was waiting
with the
bronze.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_81.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="346" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Not a word
was spoken.</p>
<p>The messenger
of the
Bear tribe
took the bag of bronze, and Lodrix
with the other messenger
hurried across the bridge to his
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>There his mother and father
and all his tribe were waiting to
welcome him.</p>
<p>They crowded about the chief&rsquo;s
hut and listened, as Lodrix told
the story of his capture.</p>
<p>When Lodrix had finished his
story, he went into the hut to
rest.</p>
<p>He soon fell asleep, tired from
his long journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Then the chief sent two men
to pull up the drawbridge which
had been down since early morning.</p>
<p>He still feared that the Bear
tribe would attack them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_83.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="243" />
</div>
<p>After this had been done, the
chief said to his people: &ldquo;My
son has returned to us. Now
we must think of winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our fruit-trees have been
destroyed by our enemies and
we have very little dried fruit
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to hunt and
fish every day, that we may have
enough food to last us through
the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the chief was talking, a
messenger, who had been sent
by the people of another Lake
village, came up.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Chief, my people
offer help to you and your
tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know that your fruit-trees
have been destroyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have plenty of food to
give you if
you need it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are
glad that your
son has been
returned to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_85.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="349" height="600" />
</div>
<p>This message
made the
Lake-Dweller
people very
happy, and before separating, they
planned to come together that
night for a feast of thanksgiving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>At sunset, as they sat eating
and drinking, they made a solemn
pledge that some day they would
conquer the Bear tribe and get
back their bronze.</p>
<p>That night the moon shone
upon them, as they stood with
outstretched arms, praying to it
for strength to fulfil their vow.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
